# Testing
Hey, thanks for testing Paris â€” I really appreciate that. 

This framework has been worked on for around 6 months but is still very new, I've stopped and started on the project multiple amounts of times and now I'm pushing to get it live.

## Things to do
1. Can you clone, npm install and run gulp successfully, If not log an issue (with your terminal output)
2. Does the structure work for you?
3. What files would you like to see added?
4. Experiment with the grid system (no docs just yet)
5. Tell me why you think this is a good framework
6. Tell me why you think this is a bad framework
7. Look for bugs
8. Look for improvements
9. Anything else you can think of
